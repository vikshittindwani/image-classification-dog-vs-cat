# 🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Image Classification

This repository contains a deep learning project for binary image classification: distinguishing between dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately classifies images as either a dog or a cat. It includes:

- Data preprocessing & augmentation
- CNN model architecture
- Model training and validation
- Evaluation metrics
- Prediction on new/unseen images

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Activation: ReLU
- Pooling: MaxPooling2D
- Regularization: Dropout
- Final Activation: Sigmoid (for binary classification)

## 🧪 Performance Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Results

| Metric   | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Accuracy | 95%+  |
| Loss     | Low   |

> Performance may vary based on the dataset split and training epochs.
